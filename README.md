# Project Overview

This project is a web application that connects to a Microsoft SQL Server database named `supremoDB`. The application is configured to use Entity Framework for data access and is built using ASP.NET Core framework. The main objective of the application is to provide users with a reliable interface to interact with the database backend.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these instructions:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install the required dependencies:**
   Make sure you have [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) installed. Then, navigate to your project directory and run:
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

3. **Configure the database:**
   Ensure that your SQL Server instance is running and the connection string in `appsettings.json` is correct. You can modify it if necessary:
   ```json
   "ConnectionStrings": {
     "DefaultConnection": "Server=YOUR_SERVER_NAME;Database=supremoDB;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true"
   }
   ```

4. **Run the application:**
   Start the application by running:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can access it in your web browser at `http://localhost:5000`. From there, you can interact with the application features as intended.

## Features

- Connect to a SQL Server database using Entity Framework.
- CRUD operations on database entities.
- Configurable logging levels via the `appsettings.json` file.

## Dependencies

- **.NET Core SDK**: Ensure you have the appropriate version installed to support ASP.NET Core applications.
- Additional dependencies will be listed in the `package.json` file. Since no `package.json` is provided, verify the project for any additional NuGet packages that may be required.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into a hierarchical structure, which generally includes the following components:

```
/<project-root>
│
├── appsettings.json         # Configuration file for connection strings and logging
├── Program.cs               # Entry point of the application
├── Startup.cs               # Configures services and middleware
├── Controllers/             # Contains the controller classes
└── Models/                  # Contains the models/entities used in the application
```

### Additional Notes

- Make sure to check for any migrations and update your database schema as necessary using Entity Framework commands.
- Adjust logging levels based on your development or production environment needs in the `appsettings.json`.

For further development and feature enhancements, please refer to the project documentation or reach out to the developers.

Happy Coding!
